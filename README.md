ðŸš€ Simply Accounting â€“ Automated Custom Quote Form integrated with CRM Integration & Smart Pricing! ðŸ’¼ðŸ“©

We just launched a dynamic lead capture + quote delivery system for Simply Accounting, fully powered by Wix Velo and custom backend logic â€” designed to streamline pricing, capture leads, and trigger personalized quote emails in seconds.

âœ… What We Implemented:
ðŸ”§ Smart Pricing Engine â€“ Built a logic-based quote calculator that dynamically matches prices based on business type, turnover, VAT, and bookkeeping needs.
ðŸ“¬ Automated Email Triggering â€“ As soon as a user submits the form, the system:
Creates a contact in the Wix CRM
Sends a personalized email quote using Wixâ€™s triggered email system
ðŸ§  Data Validation + Error Handling â€“ Every submission is validated and sanitized before processing to ensure accuracy and integrity.
ðŸ§© CRM Sync â€“ New leads are automatically created in Wix Contacts for future campaigns, client nurturing, and support follow-ups.
ðŸ“ˆ No-Code Experience, Full Automation â€“ Business owners can now generate custom pricing quotes and capture leads without any manual steps.
ðŸ’¬ Whether you're an accountant, agency, or service providerâ€”automating your quote process saves time, reduces errors, and helps convert faster.
